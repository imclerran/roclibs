# The Unusual Science Experiment

\\BEGIN STORY
In the wacky laboratory of Professor [1. name (masculine)], he embarked on his most ambitious experiment yet: turning (a/an) [2. animal] into (a/an) [3. object]. He carefully placed the unsuspecting [4. same as 2] into his giant [5. generic place] with blinking lights and spinning [6. plural object].

He pulled the [7. part of the body] on his machine, which instantly made (a/an) [8. adjective] whirring sound. "It's alive!" he exclaimed, which wasn't entirely correct or relevant, but (a/an) [9. exclamation] nonetheless.

After a minute of dramatic pauses and flaring nostrils, the [same as 2] emerged, looking slightly [10. adjective] but otherwise unchanged. "Hmm," muttered the professor, scratching his [11. part of the body]. "Maybe I should add (a/an) [12. silly word] of [13. type of liquid]."

So, he poured (a/an) [same as 13] into the machine, creating an (a/an) [14. adjective] puff of smoke. When it cleared, the [same as 2] was now wearing (a/an) [15. article of clothing] for no apparent reason.

Feeling a bit defeated, the professor accidentally knocked over (a/an) [16. adjective] [17. object], blowing up his entire [18. type of room]. As the dust settled, the [same as 2] trotted off, becoming the first [19. animal] ever to witness (a/an) [20. abstract noun].

Professor [same as 1] sighed, "Well, at least I made (a/an) [21. adjective] friend."
