# The Unbelievable Alien Visitor

\\BEGIN STORY
It was a normal Tuesday when (a/an) [1. adjective] spaceship landed right in the middle of my [2. geographical location]. I watched in disbelief as an alien with six [3. part of the body (plural)] stepped out, waving (a/an) [4. object].

"(A/An) [5. adjective] greetings, Earthling!" it said, its [6. verb (ending in -ing)] voice echoing through the air. It seemed friendly enough, but then it boldly demanded (a/an) [7. type of food].

Confused, I offered [8. type of food (plural)], which it gobbled up faster than (a/an) [9. animal] chasing a [10. object]. Then, without warning, it started to [11. verb] my backyard.

"Hey, [12. name]!" I shouted to my neighbor, who was peeking over the fence with (a/an) [13. silly word] expression on her face. "Bring more [14. type of food (plural)]!"

We both stood there, (a/an) [15. adjective] [16. occupation] and a puzzled [17. abstract noun], as the alien expertly turned the backyard into (a/an) [18. adjective] art installation of [19. plural object] and [20. plural object]. 

Before leaving, the alien gifted us (a/an) [21. adjective] [22. object], which promptly started [23. verb (ending in -ing)]. It hummed (a/an) [24. adjective] tune as its spaceship disappeared into the sky, leaving us with more questions than answers.
