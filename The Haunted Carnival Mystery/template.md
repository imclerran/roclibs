# The Haunted Carnival Mystery

\\BEGIN STORY
It all began on a dark and [1. adjective] night when my cousin and I decided to visit the old [2. generic place] on the outskirts of town. Everyone said it was haunted, but we were feeling [3. adjective] and curious.

As we entered, the smell of [4. type of liquid] filled the air, and a [5. animal] darted past us into the shadows. We heard the distant sound of [6. plural noun], followed by a loud [7. exclamation] that made us both jump.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a broken [8. noun]. It was (a/an) [9. occupation] holding a [10. noun] in one hand and a [11. noun] in the other. They moved [12. adverb], eyes glowing with (a/an) [13. adjective] light.

My cousin whispered, "Let's [14. verb] before it sees us," but it was too late. The figure began [15. verb (ending in -ing)] toward us, muttering something in an ancient, [16. adjective] language.

We ran past a line of [17. plural noun], knocking over a [same as 10] as we escaped. Just when we thought we were safe, a [same as 5] reappeared and blocked our path.

With no choice, we climbed into (a/an) [18. noun] and rolled downhill until we crashed into a pile of [19. plural noun]. Dazed, we looked at each other and started [20. verb (ending in -ing)] uncontrollably.

To this day, no one believes our story about the [same as 2], but we both know what we saw.
