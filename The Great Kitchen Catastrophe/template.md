"[5. Exclamation]!" I shouted, watching (a/an) [6. noun] spin through the air and land in the bowl of [7. plural noun]. We tried to salvage it, but then the oven started making (a/an) [8. adjective] noise. My cousin grabbed (a/an) [9. noun] and poked the oven door cautiously.

Suddenly, a puff of [10. type of liquid] burst out, covering us in (a/an) [11. adjective] cloud. We slipped on the floor, knocking over the [12. plural noun] and accidentally [13. verb (past tense)] the [14. part of the body].

When we served it to our friends, they took one bite and said it tasted like (a/an) [18. adjective] mix of [19. plural noun] and [20. plural noun].
