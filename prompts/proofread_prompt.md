I am going to show you a short story or text which will be parsed and injested programmatically. It is a fill-in-the-blank story/text. Because it will be parsed programmatically, it is very important that it follows some specific rules I will give you. I want you to check to make sure that it follows these rules:

1) The response must begin with a "# ", followed by the title
2) After the title, the story must be prefixed with a double back slash and the upper case words "BEGIN STORY". IE: "\\BEGIN STORY". There may be whitespace between the title and the begin story tag.
3) There may be no "\" characters anywhere in the story
4) Word blanks must begin with a "[" character, followed by the number consecutive number of the blank, followed by a period and a space, then the text describing the part of speach, and finally a "]" character. 
5) Any plural markers must fall inside the square brackets, not outside.
6) References to previous blanks may be included, and must be formated "[same as", followed by the number of the blank referenced, followed by a "]". Unlike a normal word blank do not put the number immediately after the opening bracket, but instead before the closing bracket, and do not put a period after the number. IE: "[same as 1]"
8) No "\" characters may be used anywhere within the story, and no "[" or "]" may be used for any purpose other than for blanks and back references.
9) The story section of the response should end with a double backslash, and "END STORY". IE: "\\END STORY".
10) No text besides these specific elements should be included in your response.
11) EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: all text in the document must be valid ascii - no special quotes, apostrophes or or em dashes, etc.

Second, you should also make sure that the articles preceeding any fill-in-the-blank spaces make grammatical sense. Any time an a or an *would* be used in the story, it should say "(a/an)" instead, to handle the ambiguity caused by the blank. However, if a definite article (the) is used, it should not also say "(a/an)". The same applies to possessive articles like "his" or "her". Additionally, some nouns may not need an article preceeding them at all (use your best judgement here to determine what would flow best in the story) or should be proceeded by a plural article like "some". Again, use your best judgement to determine what would flow and make grammatical sense. 

Make sure you do respond with the edited text ONLY. Do not add any additional explanitive, polite, or conversational text.
