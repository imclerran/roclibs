# The Unbelievable Unicorn Uprising

\\BEGIN STORY
It all started when I woke up to find (a/an) [1. adjective] unicorn standing in my [2. location (room)], munching on my [3. plural noun]. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but then it sneezed [4. type of liquid] all over my [5. part of the body].

"Well, that's [6. adjective]," I muttered, grabbing (a/an) [7. noun] to clean up the mess. The unicorn looked at me with (a/an) [8. adjective] glare and demanded [9. plural noun].

I tried to appease it with (a/an) [10. silly word] dance, but that only made it [11. verb] louder. Suddenly, my neighbor, a retired [12. occupation], burst in wielding (a/an) [13. noun] and shouting "[14. Exclamation]!"

The unicorn retaliated by summoning a squad of [15. Animal (plural)] wearing [16. article of clothing (plural)] and armed with (a/an) [17. noun]. A fierce battle broke out in the [same as 2], leaving my [18. plural noun] in ruins and my fridge full of [19. type of liquid].

In the end, we negotiated peace over a cup of [20. noun] and agreed that unicorns could stay as long as they promised not to [21. verb] my [22. plural noun] ever again.
